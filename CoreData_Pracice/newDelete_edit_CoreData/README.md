# *Edit core data and updated delete in core data*

In this long project I learned how to edit data in Core Data using custom table view. Moreover, in the [delete_from_coreData](https://github.com/DanMint/IOS-apps/tree/main/CoreData_Pracice/delete_from_coreData) i ran into a problem that after i deleted an entry the tabe view did not refresh. In this project i have understood and implemtted the auto refresh after deletion of a entry in form core data.
