# *Edit core data and updated delete in core data*

In this long project I learned how to edit data in Core Data using custom table view. Moreover, in the[ delete_from_coreData](https://github.com/DanMint/IOS-apps/tree/main/CoreData_Pracice/delete_from_coreData) i ran into a problem that after i deleted an entry the table view did not refresh. In this project i have understood and implemtted the auto refresh after deletion of a entry form core data. In the next project i want to implement a time tracker that sees if a new days occures and if its a new day it asks to input a value. Below i will incldue pictures and descriptions of the app (I will include the main views because there are alot of views)
