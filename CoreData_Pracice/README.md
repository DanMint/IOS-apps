# Project description

I started working on the financial planner app, however i have run into some problems. Firstly i needed to store user inputs. I could have used user defualts,
however it would not feel correct to use them. If I over load user defaults with data the app will be very slow + it will take alot of time to open. So i opted to
use appels data base that is inbuilt intio xcode called CoreData. With CoreData comes alot to learn so this project will be just learning the basics of CoreData 
and understanding how CoreData works.

## *Project names and thier discriptions*

1. [*PRACTICE_TABELS*](https://github.com/DanMint/IOS-apps/tree/main/CoreData_Pracice/PRACTICE_TABELS): This is not necessarily working with core data but its understanding how to display data in a table view.

2. [*delete_from_coreData*](https://github.com/DanMint/IOS-apps/tree/main/CoreData_Pracice/delete_from_coreData): In this mini project i have learned how to delete data from Core Data enteties. Moreover, I have implemented 2 types of custom table views and 1 default table view.

3. [*newDelete_edit_CoreData*](https://github.com/DanMint/IOS-apps/tree/main/CoreData_Pracice/newDelete_edit_CoreData): In this more or less long project i have learned how to delete more optimaly from core data (after every delete the custom table view auto refreshes) and how to edit/modify data in core data.

4. [*pop_up_view_for_input*](https://github.com/DanMint/IOS-apps/tree/main/CoreData_Pracice/pop_up_view_for_input): In this short and fun project I have learned how to create a pop up view that asks the user to input data every minute and stores it in core data.
