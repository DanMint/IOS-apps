I started working on the financial planner app, however i have run into some problems. Firstly i needed to store user inputs. I could have used user defualts,
however it would not feel correct to use them. If I over load user defaults with data the app will be very slow + it will take alot of time to open. So i opted to
use appels data base that is inbuilt intio xcode called CoreData. With CoreData comes alot to learn so this project will be just learning the basics of CoreData 
and understanding how CoreData works.
