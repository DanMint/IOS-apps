# *Created a pop up that asks to input new vlaue every minute*

In this small and fast project where I implemted a view that pops up every minute that reuiers a user to input data which is stored to Core Data. The reason for creating this project is to apply it to my main project called **Track me**. In this project I have learned how to use time to make certin views pop up (I did it by storing the time into Core Data and checki).Below are listed pictures of the app and description of every photo.
